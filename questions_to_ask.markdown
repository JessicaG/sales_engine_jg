What else should we test for our merchant relationships

How does .items work on merchant according to the spec harness?
ensuring that once you have an array of items, you can specifically search by name ad

Is the way we wrote the tests similar to the spec harness?
  Is it ok to just run the spec harness occasionally?

Anytime!
